    "\n",
    "## P-class\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Sorting a list: \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a list integers, m, sort all items in the list such that the first element is the smallest, the final element is the greatest, and each element is greater than the one before it but less than the one after it.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) We know this problem to decidable. It is the language of all such lists that strictly increase in value. This is because we can construct a Turing machine that will always sort the list perfectly, and necessarily always halts on a list input. One such Turing Machine is given below in problem C. But in short, so long as a turing machine (or lambda calculus) that always outputs correctly, and always gives an answer (halt), then we know the problem is decidable. That is what we try to show.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) To prove this is the case, take multi-tape Turing machine T below, with w being a string encoding of any finite numerical list, delimited with “,” between n entries:\n",
    "\n",
    "Turing Machine T on input w:\n",
    " 1. Tape head begins on first element\n",
    " 2. Store first element in second tape\n",
    " 3. Repeat the following n-1 times (until end of list)\n",
    "     1. Move head to the right\n",
    "     2. Compare new value at head location with stored value in tape 2\n",
    "     3. If head location value is larger\n",
    "         1. Pop stored value from tape 2\n",
    "         2. Insert head location value into tape 2\n",
    "         3. Repeat from step 3.1\n",
    "     4. If head location value is smaller\n",
    "         1. Pop head value from tape 1\n",
    "         2. Insert into tape 2\n",
    "         3. Pop stored value from tape 2\n",
    "         4. Insert into tape 1, effectively swapping the two values\n",
    "         5. Repeat from step 3.1\n",
    " 4. Repeat from step 1.0 n times\n",
    " 5. Halt and output tape 1 as new list\n",
    "\n",
    "(Certain sub-actions, such as comparisons, inserting values into another tape etc. are already known to be within the power of a theoretical TM, and can be achieved in polynomial time as well. We'll assume the same for this implementation as well.)\n",
    "This TM implementation follows that of a simple bubble sort. Essentially, we compare two elements side-by side, swapping them if the former element is greater. Then move on to next indices and so forth until end of the list. By the end of the first pass, the largest value will for sure have \"bubbled\" up to the top. By the second, the second largest and so fort. After n-passes we have a sure fire way of outputing a list\n",
    " \n",
    "d) Bubble sort is not even close to the most efficient list sorting algorithm (it's quite infamous for being slow), but nonetheless is well within polynomial time. With the implementation above, steps 1.0 and 2.0 both occur within O(1) time. The loop within step 3 does a total of roughly n-1 head moves to the right, n-1 comparisons, n-1 pops, and n-1 inserts, so 4(n-1), which is nonetheless O(N). We however, repeat this O(N) procedure N times. So in the end we arrive at  $ O(1) + O(N) \\times O(N) $ which is effecivly $O(N^2)$. This is a polynomial time-complexity, proving sorting a list occurs in polynomial time (of course, faster search methods have an even faster time-complexity, but still polynomial time).\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## NP-Class\n",
    "\n",
    "a) The traveling salesman decision problem (TSP_DEC) describes a graph-based problem where, beginning from node A, we try to decide if a route of at least length k that passes through all other nodes once, returning to the starting node A, exists. In other words, a \"roundtrip\" from point A that also passes every node, and is at most length k.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Let language L be all route of a graph that connects all nodes, starting and ending from the same node, with length less than k.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) We can prove that a problem is NP if a verifier, V, exists such that V can decide if a solution to a problem, or the certificate, c, is correct, in polynomial time. Let k be the minimum distance of our problem, and s be the starting node. We can build V as so:\n",
    "\n",
    "Verifier, V, on input <<G,k,s>, c>:\n",
    "1. Test that c is a proper subgraph of G\n",
    "2. Test that c contains all nodes of G\n",
    "3. Test that c visits all nodes exactly once (except for starting node s)\n",
    "4. Test that c is a closed path (starts and ends at s)\n",
    "5. Test that sum of all length of all edges in c is less than k\n",
    "6. If steps 1-5 all pass, accept\n",
    "    1. Otherwise reject\n",
    "    \n",
    "Our verifier, V, is able to validate a proposed solution to TSP-DEC, c, \"quickly.\" Each step from 1-5 occurs in O(n) time, since we just have to repeat an O(1) action (see if node is in graph, see if node is already visited etc.) n number of times, resulting in O(n) time. Furthermore, step six occurs in O(6)=O(1) time, leading our total time complexity still at O(n). V is also comprehensive enough to ensure that the solution is indeed correct. So long as all steps 1-5 pass, then c must be a true certificate. Our verifier works properly, and in polynomial time, which means TSP-DEC is in NP.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Our proof works from the assumption that the Hamiltonian Path and, therefore by extension, the Hamiltonian Cycle Problem (HCP) are NP-Complete (Sisper Theorem 7.46). A hamiltonian cycle is a hamiltonian path that, well, cycles: it goes through each vertex once but starts and ends at the same vertex. The HCP is deciding whether or not such a path exists in a graph. If we can reduce HCP to TSP-DEC, in polynomial time, then TSP-DEC must also be NP-complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our setup requires a few more changes in perspectives. We can think of the distances in TSP as \"costs,\" and we're effectively trying to minimizing the cost of visiting each node plus returning. In more formal terms, HCP says, given a graph H=(V,E), determine if a Hamiltonian Cycle exists in H. We can now begin our reduction. Let's start with graph H. We can then construct a graph T, by simply turing H into a complete graph (connecting every edge to every other edge, or the sum of H and H's complement). Graph T is emblematic to a TSP-DEC graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we will also assign weights to each edge of T according to the following cost equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\forall t = (u,v) \\in T$ <br/>\n",
    "$C(t) = 0$, if $(u,v) \\in H$ <br/>\n",
    "$C(t) = 1$, if $(u,v) \\notin H$ <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we know that our original graph, H, has a hamiltonian cycle if and only if T has a tour of cost of at most 0 (a cycle that goes through every node once with total cost <= 0). This is because in H, if H had hamiltonian cycle, all those edges in T will have a cost of 0, resulting in a tour of cost no more than zero. Afterall, all other edges are assigned value of \"1\". By finding a tour of cost in T <= 0, we effectively also solve the TSP-DEC problem where k<=0. This means we've successfully reduced HCP to TSP-DEC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our last step is to show that this mapping, reduction, can occur in polynomial time. We already know we can do so for construction of H, the complement of a graph can be built through a breadth-first-search approach which occurs in polynomial time. Furthermore, the labelling of edges through our cost function, C, is also in polynomial time. No component of our reduction requires more than polynomial time, so we've successfully reduced an NP-Complete problem (HCP) to TSP-DEC, proving that TSP-DEC is NP-Complete as well."

    "## Boolean Satisfiability Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "a) The Horn Satisfiability Problem (HORNSAT) is the problem of deciding whether or not a set of propositional Horn clauses is satisfiable or not. A Horn clause contains at most one positive literal, called the \"head,\" and any number of negative literals. For example, (A $\\cup$ $\\neg$B $\\cup$  $\\neg$C) is a horn clause, but (A $\\cup$ B $\\cup$ $\\neg$C), (A $\\cup$ B $\\cup$ C), ($\\neg$A $\\cup$ B $\\cup$ C) are not valid horn clauses. We know that HORNSAT is not NP-Complete because we now have polynomial time algorithms that can solve HORNSAT (as will be shown in part b)). Until someone proves NP=P, any problem in P is not considered NP-Complete. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our general strategy will be to use rules of unit propagation. If the formula contains a singular clause with literal L (unit clause), then all clauses containing L, except the unit clause, are removed. All clauses containing $\\neg$L, have $\\neg$L removed. Furthermore, these new clauses that result from removing certain literals may result in unit rules themselves (for example, (A $\\cup$ $\\neg$L) becomes (A)), and so we repeat the cycle. If there are no unit clauses, the formula can be satisfied by simply setting all remaining variables negative. The formula is unsatisfiable if this transformation generates a pair of opposite unit clauses L and $\\neg$L. With this being said, we can now begin our polynomial time algorithmic implementation.\n",

    "c) Even though the specific problem above can be solved in non-exponential time, many SAT problems still can not. There are a few possibilities for this, I'll begin with the most plausible one. 1) The heuristic applied to HORNSAT simply does not work for other SAT problems. It is very likely that the specific heuristic we used for HORNSAT, unit propagation, does not work in the same way it would for other SAT problems. This much seems true, unit propagation won't reduce other SAT problems greatly enough to be solvable in nonexponential time. 2) We can not map every SAT problem to one another. For example, given regular 3SAT problems, there probably isn't a way to turn all of them into horn clauses and horn formulas, or vice versa. Horn clauses could be specific and unique enough such that their property can not be easily reduced. In this sense, they're drastically different problems. 3) We just haven't found a way to solce other SAT problems yet. Underneath everything said so hard, there rests a million dollar (likely more) solution to prove that NP=P. This would suggest we can solve SAT problems, in fact, any of them, in polynomial time, but some really smart mathematician/researcher just has to find it. It would be akin to Newton knowing about gravity but not what it is or why it works: the answer is there we just have to wait for someone to find it. In that sense, other SAT problems are not NP-Complete, just waiting to be P."

Through understanding certain fundamental patterns in a proposed problem, then how simple recursion can help us unpack and simplify the problem, we're able to reduce what would otherwise be a very complex problem into one that can be solved in nonexponential time. For example, if A is a unit clause, we know it must be true (or else the whole clause is false, and thereby the entire formula, a large logical conjunction, would evaluate false). Since A is true, any other clause, a series of disjunctions, will also be true, so we can linearly remove all such clauses (in a disjunction, only one element needs to be true). Furthermore, any appearance of the negation of A will necessarily be false, so we might as well remove them since it would be redundant to evaluate them. If there were another true literal in that clause, the whole is true anyways. Thus, our code sticks by this heuristic, drastically decreasing the number of steps and comparisons, and ultimately resulting in a linear time algorithm (for more see citation below. I believe these are the authors of the original linear time solution, and I must say it's all quite brilliant. Worth checking out.)\n",

    "\\#breakitdown - This HC was strongly applied in the HCP to TSP-DEC reudction problem in Question 2. In order to begin deriving a solution, the problem was first broken down into basic components. What the problem constitutes, which variables and parts are at play, and how do solving both problems operate. We need all this information so we can figure out how to do a polynomial time reduction from one to the other. Once each broken down part is small enough to be tractable (how do we translate certain terms, what individual steps are needed in our proof etc.), we solve each individual portion, and finally reconstruct into a large overall answer (the proof conclusion). Through a strategic and effective application of #breakitdown, a cohesive, tractable, and above all, sound proof is given.\n",

    "\\#algorithms - This HC was applied throughout the assignment, but notably in Turing Machine/Verifier algorithms, as well as 3.b). Each algorithm is clear, concise, and works to achieve the goal its been set out to do. For the informal algorithms, explanations are given as to what the higher level effect of certain sets of steps achieve. The algorithms are also thorough enough to include all members of language, and carefully revised to be inclusive but \"exclusively inclusive\" of members of a language. As for 3.b), strong testing is provided to ensure that the algorithm works. From simple test cases that are easily followable by hand, to large test cases to ensure robustness, a plethora of variety of test cases are given to account for all edge cases. Of course, its not perfect, there can be chance for error, but the algorithm is at least functional for the variety of cases that is provided, which is already quite a bit for most intents and purposes. Lastly, the code is more or less commented line by line for readability, giving viewers and reviewers a better chance to see not only what is happening, but also why something might not be behaving the way we expect it to. The algorithm is well-written, simplified, but strongly and creatively implements a rather complex solution to a problem."
